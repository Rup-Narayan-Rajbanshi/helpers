docker run redis 

docker run python echo hello rup : display message for running python container

docker run python ls : display files under python container

docker ps : show running container

docker ps --all : show running container as well as exited container

docker create hello-world : create a docker container

""  
-a = display what is going on with the container.

docker run --publish 3000:80 nginx : run nginx in different port in local system.

docker rm <container_id> ==> delete container

docker rm $(docker ps -a -q -f status=exited) ==> deletes all containers that have a status of exited
docker container prune ==> This will remove all stopped containers.
docker kill $(docker ps -q) ==> kill all running containers

docker logs <container_id> ==> for container logs

docker stop <container_id>

docker kill <container_id>

docker exec -i -t <container_id> sh  ==> run another command in container shell
""
-i = attach with std in.
-t = preety formatting

docker build .   ==> create container form docker file.

docker images : list down docker images

docker system prune -a :This will remove:
                        - all stopped containers
                        - all networks not used by at least one container
                        - all images without at least one container associated to them
                        - all build cache


docker-compose logs -f ==> errors for docker-compose

 Build the image: == docker-compose build
 
 Once the image is built, run the container  ==  docker-compose up -d

Docker File 
example :
# Specify the base image
From alpine

# Download and install dependencies

RUN apk add --update redis

# Set up the startup command.
CMD ["redis-server"]

It builts a container with id 
then run 
docker run container_id



changes for project:
-comment must be written above each command in docker file.

-db connection.(database configuration from setting file)

-volume mount


DOCKER COMMANDS:

ADD – Defines files to copy from the Host file system onto the Container
ADD ./local/config.file /etc/service/config.file
CMD – This is the command that will run when the Container starts
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
ENTRYPOINT – Sets the default application used every time a Container is created from the Image. If used in conjunction with CMD, you can remove the application and just define the arguments there
CMD Hello World!
ENTRYPOINT echo
ENV – Set/modify the environment variables within Containers created from the Image.
ENV VERSION 1.0
EXPOSE – Define which Container ports to expose
EXPOSE 80
FROM – Select the base image to build the new image on top of
FROM ubuntu:latest
LABEL maintainer – Optional field to let you identify yourself as the maintainer of this image. This is just a label (it used to be a dedicated Docker directive).
LABEL maintainer=someone@xyz.xyz"
RUN – Specify commands to make changes to your Image and subsequently the Containers started from this Image. This includes updating packages, installing software, adding users, creating an initial database, setting up certificates, etc. These are the commands you would run at the command line to install and configure your application. This is one of the most important dockerfile directives.
RUN apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y && apt-get install -y nginx && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
USER – Define the default User all commands will be run as within any Container created from your Image. It can be either a UID or username
USER docker
VOLUME – Creates a mount point within the Container linking it back to file systems accessible by the Docker Host. New Volumes get populated with the pre-existing contents of the specified location in the image. It is specially relevant to mention is that defining Volumes in a Dockerfile can lead to issues. Volumes should be managed with docker-compose or “docker run” commands. Volumes are optional. If your application does not have any state (and most web applications work like this) then you don’t need to use volumes.
VOLUME /var/log
WORKDIR – Define the default working directory for the command defined in the “ENTRYPOINT” or “CMD” instructions
WORKDIR /home
